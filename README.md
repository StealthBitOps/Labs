## 🛡️ TryHackMe: Pentesting Fundamentals

---

#### 🧭 Objectives
- Understand the role and responsibilities of a penetration tester.
- Learn the ethical and legal foundations of ethical hacking.
- Explore different testing scopes: black-box, white-box, and grey-box.
- Apply a structured methodology to conduct a basic penetration test.
- Familiarise with industry frameworks: OSSTMM, OWASP, NIST, and NCSC CAF.

#### 🧠 Skills Explored
- Ethical hacking principles and legal boundaries.
- Hacker classifications: white hat, grey hat, black hat.
- Writing and interpreting Rules of Engagement (_ROE_).
- Reconnaissance and enumeration techniques.
- Exploitation and privilege escalation strategies.
- Framework-driven testing approaches.

#### 🛠️ Tools Overview
- `Nmap` – Network scanning and service enumeration.
- `Metasploit` – Exploitation and post-exploitation.
- `Wireshark` – Packet analysis and traffic inspection.
- `Burp Suite` – Web application testing (_conceptual_).
- TryHackMe virtual lab – Simulated infrastructure for hands-on practice.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Pentesting Methodology_)
1. **Information Gathering** – Passive OSINT and target profiling.
2. **Enumeration/Scanning** – Identifying open ports and services.
3. **Exploitation** – Gaining access via vulnerabilities.
4. **Privilege Escalation** – Expanding access within the system.
5. **Post-Exploitation** – Pivoting, data extraction, and reporting.
